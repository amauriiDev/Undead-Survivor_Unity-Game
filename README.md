# Undead Survivor

Undead Survivor is a game project I created to learn about programming in game development and acquire skills. It was developed from beginning to end by me and I had the experience of going through all the steps in creating a game.


## Learnings

I could write an entire book here. The amount of challenges I faced and how much I learned creating this project was something extremely surreal.
If you're going to talk about technical terms that I learned and put into practice in this project, here's the list:
- O.O.P (indispensable);
- Interfaces;
- Action Events;
- Decoupled programming;
- Singleton Design Pattern;
- And many other details of the engine itself.


## Reference

All the sprites and sounds used were from a free Asset on the Asset Store, and that's where the name of the project comes from.

the background music was taken from [beatoven.ai](beatoven.ai) and the other one I lost the link (lol)
